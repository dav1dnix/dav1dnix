### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am David
I don't program much, I mainly maintain a repository for Hackintosh and I will upload scripts [here](https://gist.github.com/dav1dnix) sometimes.

If you're chill or have any questions, you can find me on [Telegram](https://t.me/david_priv) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dav1d_nix).
